# iTeach: Interactive Teaching for Robot Perception using Mixed Reality 🤖🌐

[Project Webpage](https://irvlutd.github.io/iTeach/)

## Abstract 📝

We introduce **iTeach**, a Mixed Reality (MR) framework designed to enhance robot perception through real-time interactive teaching. By enabling human instructors to dynamically label robot RGB data, iTeach improves both the accuracy and adaptability of robot perception to new scenarios. The framework supports on-the-fly data collection and labeling, enhancing model performance and generalization. Applied to door and handle detection for household tasks, iTeach integrates a HoloLens app with an interactive YOLO model. Furthermore, we introduce the **IRVLUTD DoorHandle** dataset. **DH-YOLO**, our efficient detection model, significantly boosts the accuracy and efficiency of door and handle detection, showcasing the potential of MR to make robotic systems more capable and adaptive in real-world environments.
