<p>We introduce <strong>iTeach</strong>, a Mixed Reality (MR) framework designed to enhance robot perception through real-time interactive teaching. By enabling human instructors to dynamically label robot RGB data, iTeach improves both the accuracy and adaptability of robot perception to new scenarios. The framework supports on-the-fly data collection and labeling, enhancing model performance and generalization. Applied to door and handle detection for household tasks, iTeach integrates a HoloLens app with an interactive YOLO model. Furthermore, we introduce the <strong>IRVLUTD DoorHandle</strong> dataset. <strong>DH-YOLO</strong>, our efficient detection model, significantly boosts the accuracy and efficiency of door and handle detection, showcasing the potential of MR to make robotic systems more capable and adaptive in real-world environments.</p>

## Getting Started in only 3 steps 🚀 !!!

The iTeach system can be started in just 3 simple steps:

**Step-1**: Build and install the **iTeachLabeller** app on the HoloLens 2.
  - [App Download Link](https://utdallas.app.box.com/v/iTeachLabellerApp) 📱
  - [App Install Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xFtCPSMTEk) 🛠️

**Step-2**: Navigate to the [src](./src) directory and follow the setup instructions in its [README](./src/README.md) file 📚.  
**Step-3**: Start interacting with the app—navigate the robot, collect faulty samples, label them, and fine-tune the model. [Real World Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fusb4CkM_IE) 🤖

✨ We show a demo of setting up the experiment hardware, network, and scripts to be run in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ7Is0SrNgc) 🎦. For detailed steps, refer to the video description 📋.

## Directory Structure 📁

  For the [toolkit](./toolkit) and [dataloader](./dataloader), execute the following commands with each new PyPI build:
  
  ```bash
  rm -rf build/ dist/ # Also remove the corresponding .egg-info directory
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel # Make sure to change the version in setup.py before running this
  twine upload dist/* # Ensure you have the pypi-token
```
