# iTeach: Interactive Teaching for Robot Perception using Mixed Reality

[Project Webpage](https://irvlutd.github.io/iTeach/)

## Abstract

We introduce iTeach, a Mixed Reality (MR) framework to improve robot perception through real-time interactive teaching. By allowing human instructors to dynamically label robot RGB data, iTeach improves both the accuracy and adaptability of robot perception to new scenarios. The framework supports on-the-fly data collection and labeling, enhancing model performance, and generalization. Applied to door and handle detection for household tasks, iTeach integrates a HoloLens app with an interactive YOLO model. Furthermore, we introduce the IRVLUTD DoorHandle dataset. DH-YOLO, our efficient detection model, significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of door and handle detection, highlighting the potential of MR to make robotic systems more capable and adaptive in real-world environments.
